# XML to Map

*Copy of the tech test requirements is included [here](https://github.com/lornasw93/xml-to-map/blob/master/Tech%20Test.docx)* (with the API Key hidden)

I created a new ASP.NET Web Application in Visual Studio 2019. I installed bootstrap, jQuery and VueJS libaries, then found which scripts I needed for integrating with Google Maps API.  

## If I had more time I would have... ‚è≥
* Deployed via Azure
* Added file uploader (for XML file)
* Improved the look and feel
* More visual loading
* Error handling
* Async functions
* Unit testing

## However, I have... ‚úÖ
* Integrated with Google Maps API
* Used marker clusters
* Used VueJS (because very quick to get up and running)
* Used very basic Bootstrap (basic styling purposes)

## In the future... üîÆ
### Reading from the Database
If/when the locations are stored in a SQL database then I would've began to:
* Separate the code out i.e. create a service class (*IDatabaseService*, *DatabaseService*), where the main functionality for getting the data would live
* General functionality would be parsing the data into a list
* The controller would then call the appropriate method in the service
* Implement logging in the database in case for issues of incorrect data format

## Quick Start 

Make sure you replace the **APIKEY** value with your Google Maps API Key in the Layout.cshtml file:
```
<script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=APIKEY"></script>
```

For now, I've put the *Locations.xml* file on my local drive in a folder called *XmlToMap*, this will need changing if you're going to run it (*MapController*):
```
var directory = new DirectoryInfo("C:\\Users\\lornn\\Documents\\XmlToMap");
```

If wanting to run locally, download the repo, restore Nuget packages and run.

## Notes
In a previous role I worked on a project called "My Surgery Website" which is like Wordpress i.e. drag and drop, but from built scratch. It's used to provide websites for GP surgeries around the UK - in fact over half. I built [this map](https://www.mysurgerywebsite.co.uk/live/contact-us/) where it pin points all the locations of surgeries using it. To also note that the locations were retrieved from a SQL database where the data wasn't consistent i.e. had a mix of postcodes and lat/long.

After I left that role, I created a side project where instead of getting results from a SQL database would be from 2 files where 1 contained postcodes and the other lat/long. The aim of that project was to extract data from both files into a new JSON file. I was able to convert the postcodes by using an existing package.
